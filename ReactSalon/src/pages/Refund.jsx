          Cancellation Policies and Fees: Your spa treatments are reserved especially for you. We value your business and ask that you respect the spa's scheduling policies. Should you need to cancel or reschedule, please notify us <b className='bold'>at least 4 hours in advance.</b>
          </p>
          <p className='bodyText lineBreak'>
          Any cancellations with less than 4 hours of notice are subject to a cancelation fee amounting to the cost of the scheduled service.
          </p>
          <p className='bodyText lineBreak'>
          Refund Policy:We do not offer refunds. If, for any reason you are not satisfied, please contact the office, and we will promptly address your concerns so that you may continue to be a satisfied client. Pre-paid appointments cancelled outside of our 4 hour policy will be issued a credit or gift card in the full amount to be used for any future appointments.
          </p>
          <p className='bodyText lineBreak'>
          Clients who miss their appointments without giving any prior notification will be charged in full for the scheduled service. We recognize the time of our clients and staff is valuable and have implemented this policy for this reason. When you miss an appointment with us, we not only lose your business, but also the potential business of other clients who could have scheduled an appointment for the same time.
          </p>
          <p className='bodyText lineBreak'>
          Additionally, many times our staff will be functioning in an “on call” status and can have traveled to the spa specifically for your service. For these reasons we are obligated to compensate our staff for their time as well as make up for the lost revenue. When you schedule your appointment with us, you are agreeing to these policies. All services require a credit card or gift certificate to guarantee a reservation so please have your credit card and/or gift certificate ready when booking. You will not be billed unless there is a cancellation or no show. Upon checkout, guests may choose their method of payment.
